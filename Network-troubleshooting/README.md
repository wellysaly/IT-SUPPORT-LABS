This lab focused on building a foundational understanding of computer networking and applying basic troubleshooting techniques in simulated and virtual environments.

## Tools Used:
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Windows Network Settings
- Command-line tools (ipconfig, ping, tracert)
- Wireshark
- VirtualBox

## Problem Solved:
Simulated basic network topologies and connectivity scenarios using Cisco Packet Tracer to understand how devices communicate within a network. Troubleshot common connectivity issues such as incorrect IP addressing and unreachable hosts. Used tracert to analyze network paths and Wireshark to observe network traffic while applying structured troubleshooting steps to identify and resolve network issues.
